Road Trip Planner - Development Log
================================

Project Setup and Structure Creation
----------------------------------
1. Created basic project structure with client (React + Vite) and server (Node.js + Express) directories
2. Set up monorepo configuration in root package.json with workspaces

Client-side Development
----------------------
1. Set up React application with Vite
   - Created main entry points (App.jsx and main.jsx)
   - Configured Vite (vite.config.js) with proxy settings for API calls

2. Created core components:
   - TripForm.jsx: Form component for trip input
     * Handles start/end locations
     * Manages trip preferences (scenic, food, historical)
     * Form validation and submission logic

3. Created pages:
   - HomePage.jsx: Landing page with trip form
     * Hero section with call to action
     * Integration with TripForm component
     * Basic navigation setup

4. Set up client-side services:
   - routeService.js: API service layer
     * planRoute function for route calculation
     * getStopSuggestions function for points of interest

5. Added basic styling:
   - index.css: Global styles and variables
     * CSS reset and base styles
     * Color variables
     * Layout utilities

Server-side Development
----------------------
1. Set up Express server
   - Configured middleware (CORS, JSON parsing)
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Environment variable support with dotenv

2. Created API structure:
   - Controllers:
     * routeController.js: Handles route planning logic
     * Placeholder implementations for route planning and stop suggestions

   - Routes:
     * routeRouter.js: Express route definitions
     * Endpoints for /api/routes/plan and /api/stops/suggest

3. Prepared service integrations (to be implemented):
   - OpenRouteService/Google Maps for routing
   - Yelp API for stop suggestions
   - Weather API integration
   - Gas price API integration

Configuration and Development Setup
---------------------------------
1. Environment Configuration:
   - Added .env files for both client and server
   - Set up development ports (3000 for server, 5173 for client)
   - Added API key placeholders

2. Development Tools:
   - ESLint for code linting
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Jest for testing setup
   - Configured proxy for development
